# primeFinder

This app utilises the concept of GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) to calculate all the primes less than a given number. User can enter any number between 2 and 10000 and the number of background threads(2 to 4) to be run for the process. The results will be displayed on a table view with the number of the thread that produced the result.
